# UDP Transmitter

<p align="justify"> 
This repository contains a Qt app that takes a file as input and sends that file in UDP packets repeatedly using Qt's QUdpSocket library. The transmission rate is dependent on the CPU hardware. Maximum rate acheived with this code is about 600 Mbits/sec on an AMD ryzen 5 2600 six-core processor.
